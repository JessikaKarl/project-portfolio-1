# Portfolio Project 1 - Lilly's Café
For my first project, I chose to make a simple and stylish website for a cafe. I chose this because I've always wanted to start a cafe so it was a good fit to make a website for it.

## Design
### Colours 
I wanted to choose colours that was simple and elegant. White and black are a god colour combo and to have a contrast to dose I choose green. Green was a good colour because it is muted and looked great together with white and black. 
### Typography 
I choose the font Times New Roman from the font family serif because it is a commonly used font. Great for accessibility and dyslexi user to read. 
### Imagery 
The images I choose for this project 
### Wireframes 
Add photos. 
I tried to make the website so similer to the wireframes as possible. With what I knew about HTML and CSS it got pretty close to what I inteted.

* Text contet for this project was written by me. 
* I used W3Schools for help with the project. If I did not know how to do it or was not sure how to I looked it up there. One specific part that I need help with was the gallery. How to get the images in two culumes. After looking it up there it was much easier to continue with the project.
